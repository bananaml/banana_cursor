# 🍌 Banana <> Cursor Starter Guide 

This is a getting started guide for using Banana with Cursor, designed to help you quickly set up a serverless Banana template.

⚠️ **Caution!**: All files in this repository, with the exception of this README.md, were generated by Cursor.

To kick things off, you'll first need to integrate the [Banana documentation](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/) with Cursor. After integrating the documentation, you're all set to start asking questions. Below is an illustrative guide on using Cursor to create a serverless template for Banana. The very first command, `i want to create a serverless template on @Banana. please tell me first which files i have to create`, should be entered first into the chat window in Cursor. Every subsequent command is a follow-up question based on Cursor's response. The resulting files can be seen in this repo.:

1. `i want to create a serverless template on @Banana. please tell me first which files i have to create`
2. `cool! next please show me example code for how an app.py file could look like`
3. `nice! next please show me code i could add to my Dockerfile`
4. `what do i need to add to my requirements.txt?`
5. `what should i add to @download.py?`

Happy coding! 💻🚀
